 #### Testing The Setup
 to test the API, use any REST client to make a POST request to the end point `/{AGENT_NAME}`
  for example:
 `/coffee` for Coffee Agent.
 `/banking` for Banking Agent.
 with the headers:
 
 `authorization: Bearer YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN_HERE`
 
 `content-type: application/json`
 
 and  the body
 
 {"sms":"Hello"}
 
if everything is setup correctly you should get a response like this one


``{
  "response": "Good day! I have a lot coffee and snacks. What can I get you to drink?"
  }``
